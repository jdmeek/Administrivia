# Administrivia
Various admin tools and goodies written in powershell...bash...python...perl...batch...

Basically, this is my collection of tools that I've written over the years.  Some are good, 
some are indifferent and a couple are bad hacks but all did the job and seemed worthy of keeping.
I tend to write these tools with the primary UNIX directive in mind.  I'm almost sure that you're 
wondering what this "primary Unix directive" is, unless you already know.  But, if not...

WRITE A TOOL THAT DOES ONLY ONE THING BUT DOES THAT THING REALLY, REALLY WELL.
You know, like grep/awk/sed.

The tools are sorted into folders by the primary target that they served.  Windows, Linux, Cygwin
Splunk, etc... Inside each folder you will find a collection of scripts that serve that target in 
some way.  It could be a fix, settings application, tuning, reporting, or some other equally tedious 
task related to that target.  When you find a subfolder, that will be a collection relating to one 
thing.  A task handler, admin toolset or other app or library type thing,

The only path to true enlightenment is to read the README files.  That should have everything you 
might want to know about what you're looking at.  Well, they at least have everything that I felt
like writing about before wondering off in a squirrel moment.  Also, read the code.  I try to comment
liberally so there's goodness in them thar files.

You will likely note the use of a variety of languages in any given folder.  That's because I either
determined that the selected language was the right one or, quite possibly, I used the project as a 
learning exercise for that language.  

Finally, I'm sure that I'll break this up into several repos as I dig through the results of 25 years 
running DOS/WIN, Linux, AIX, Solaris MacOS, OSX, HPUX, DGUX and the various app/db/thingy-madoodle 
servers that run on them.  I have other repos available at https://github.com/jdmeek.  They are also 
specific to the application in the folder name but have gotten either large enough or focused enough
to warrant their own place in the world.

Finally, any file that has -tuning in the name is going to show my recommended tuning params/methods
for that platform/product.

Any way, I hope you find them useful or at least amusing.  I know that some of it is pretty bad code or
would have been cleaner another way but, hey, they all worked for the purpose.  That being said, unless
you're contributing something constructive, I really don't want to hear about how big of a dumbass I am
because I didn't use XYZ language of the month or some lame-assed half-baked framework that some zitfaced
script-kiddie thought up for god-only-knows what purpose related to which-ever MMORPG happens to be the
flavor of the day.  So, either contribute or STFU.  No one has time for trolls and you will likely be
publicly filleted if it becomes tiresome.
