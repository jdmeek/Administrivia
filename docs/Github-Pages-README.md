Various tools, packages, HOWTOs and other goodies that I've written, modded or worked on in some way.  

Basically, this is a collection of stuffz that I've written over the years.  Some are good, 
some are kinda meh, and some are really bad hax. But, all did the needful without completely trashing the system.  

I tend to write these tools with a handful of directives in mind.  
. Choice of programming language is driven by need
. New!=Better
. Every application contains at least one bug and can be optimized by at least one line.
. Mind the Primary UNIX Directive

I bet you're wondering what this "primary Unix directive" is, unless you already know.  But, if not...

WRITE A TOOL THAT DOES ONLY ONE THING BUT DOES THAT THING REALLY, REALLY WELL.

You know, like grep/awk/sed/init/cron...  Emacs broke the promise and we're not going to get into systemd.

Stuff is sorted into folders by the primary target that they served.  Windows, Linux, Cygwin
Splunk, etc.  If the target is OS agnostic, it gets its own folder.

Inside each folder you will find a collection that serves that target in some way.  It could be a fix, recommended
settings application, tuning doc, reporting, or some other equally tedious asset.  Also, any file that has -tuning 
in the name is going to contain info regarding perfomrance tuning of that particular thing-a-ma-bob.

Remember that not all who wonder are lost.  But, if you find yourself confused or angry, the only path 
to true enlightenment is to read the README files.  That should have everything you might want to know 
about what you're looking at.  Well, they at least have everything that I felt like writing.  
Also, you really should read the code.  There's a lot of info in there.

More of my madness can be found at https://github.com/jdmeek.

Any way, I hope you find them useful or at least amusing.  I know that some of it is pretty bad code or
would have been cleaner another way but, hey, they all worked for the purpose.  I really don't want to 
hear about how big of a dumbass I am because I didn't use XYZ language or framework that some zitfaced 
turd-muffin thought up for god-only-knows what purpose related to which-ever MMORPG happens to be the 
flavor of the day.  So, either contribute something positive or STFU.

Finally, I'm sure that I'll break this up into several repos as I dig through the results of 25 years 
running DOS, Windows, Linux, Minix, AIX, Solaris, MacOS, OSX, HPUX, DGUX and the various app/db/thingy-madoodle 
servers that run on them.
